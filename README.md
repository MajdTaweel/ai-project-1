## About this project
This python project uses interesting modern technologies for its GUI that I recommend checking. It uses Angular and electron.js along with Python Eel for communication between javascript and python. This way you could easily make a great GUI using web technologies with basic knowledge of web development without the need to use a python web framework like Django or Flask.
